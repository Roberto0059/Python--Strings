<h1> Python-Strings Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, you'll practice creating Python code and working with strings. You'll work with an employee ID, a device ID, and a URL, all represented as string data.

<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>
- <b>Jupyter</b>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

1. Now you'll move on to the next part of your task. Imagine that the characters in a device ID convey technical information about the device. You'll need to extract characters in specific positions from the device ID. Start off by extracting the fourth character. The variable device_id represents a device ID containing alphanumeric characters; it's already stored as a string. <br/>

2. In this task, you'll build upon the previous code. If an employee ID is only four digits, you'll use concatenation to create a five-digit employee ID number. Concatenation is a process that allows you to merge strings together. The addition operator (+) in Python allows you to concatenate two strings. Write an if statement that evaluates whether the length of employee_id is less than 5. When the condition evaluates to True, reassign employee_id by concatenating "E" in front of the four-digit employee ID to create a five character employee ID. Then, display employee_id again. <br/>
